# Proving binary search with loop invariants
-  write pseudo code for a binary search that scans looking for v

## Pseudocode
Algorithm BinarySearch(A, v)
    low = 1
    high = length(A)
    while low <= high
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if A[mid] == v
            return mid
        else if A[mid] < v
            low = mid + 1
        else
            high = mid - 1
    return nil


## Worst-case running time of binary search is Î˜(log n).
- worst-case for Binary search is when element v is not in sequence A
- Since the problem size is reduced by half with each iteration this implies that the maximum number of operations is n/2; we represent this as \log_{2}n
- Therefore, since each iteration takes \theta(1) (constant time complexity for primitive operations) and the number of iterations is \log_{2}n the worse case running time is \log_{2}n
