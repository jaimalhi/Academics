## How to modify Strassen's to account for nxn matrices where n is not an exact power of 2

Modifying Strassen's algorithm to multiply nÃ—n matrices where n is not a power of 2 involves
padding the matrices to the nearest size that is a power of 2. This modification ensures that
the matrices are compatible with the divide-and-conquer approach of Strassen's algorithm

### Modifying the Algorithm:

1. Determine the next power of 2:
   -  for a given matrix sinze n, find the smallest integer m such that m >= n and m is a power of 2
   -  this can be done using the formula m = 2^{log\_{2}n}
2. Pad the matrices:
   -  extend both matrices to m x m by adding extra rows and columns filled with zeroes
   -  this will not change result of the multiplication but makes the matrices compatible for Strassen's algorithm
3. Apply Strassen's as normal
   -  apply strassen's to the newly padded matrices
4. Extract result
   -  extract the top-left n x n submatrix as the final result
   -  this submatrix contains the product of the original matrices

### Time Complexity Analysis

-  The time complexity of Strassen's algorithm is O(n^{\log\_{2}7})
-  when modifying the algorithm for matrices of size not a power of 2, the size becomes the next power of 2 (say m)
-  Then the complexity is then O(m^{\log\_{2}7})

-  since m is the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n, we have m = O(n)
-  therefore, the time complexity of the modified algorithm is O(n^{\log\_{2}7})
