# Proving linear search with loop invariants
-  write pseudo code for a linear search that scans looking for _v_ (refer to assignment)

## Pseudocode
Algorithm LinearSearch(A, v)
    for i from 1 to length(A)
        if A[i] == v
            return i
    return nil

## Proof of Correctness using Loop Invariant
- Loop Invariant: at the start of each iteration, the value of v has not been found in previous elements of the sequence A[1...i-1]
- initialization: Before the loop starts (when i is 1), the subsequence A[1...i-1] is empty. Since there are no elements, v has not been found, so the loop invariant is trivially true.
- Maintenance: Assume the loop invariant is true before an iteration of the loop. During the i-th iteration, the algorithm checks if A[i] is equal to v. If A[i] is not equal to v, the loop moves to the next iteration, and the invariant is maintained because v has still not been found in A[1...i]. If A[i] is equal to v, the loop terminates by returning i
- Termination: The loop terminates in one of two cases:
    - the value v is found at index i for which v == A[i]
    - the value v is not found at any index returning nil
